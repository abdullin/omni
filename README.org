* Omni - Work in progress

This is a prototype library in golang for implementing event-driven
micro-services with the support for cluster simulation. See [[https://github.com/abdullin/anthill][anthill]]
project for more details.

If you are looking for the original event-driven GTD sample check out

* Folder Structure

Solution is composed from the core infrastructure and actual domain implementation.

*Infrastructure*:

- =bin= - temporary folder with compiled binaries
- =core= - event-driven infrastructure and spec runners
- =etc= - misc files (no source code)
- =host= - entry point for the process


*Domain*:

- =lang= - domain language (value objects and events)
- =task= - module for editing and managing tasks
- =views= - module with basic views for the client
- /all the rest/ - event-driven modules with features
